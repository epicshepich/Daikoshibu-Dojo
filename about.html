<h1 id="philosophy" class="title">Philosophy and Intent of Hakko&#772; Denshin Ryu&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xfe3d;</h1>
<span id="philosophy-container" class="container">
  The character &#26580;, the ju&#772; of ju&#772;jutsu, means gentleness or softness. The intention of ju&#772;jutsu, the Gentle Art, is for practitioners to defend themselves while being gentle with opponents. Among the many styles of ju&#772;jutsu, Hakko&#772; Denshin Ryu&#772; is one of the gentlest. A central idea of ju&#772;jutsu is that physical strength is not required for techniques to work. A technique can be successfully performed by relaxing, yielding to the opponent's strength, and using proper form. If a student resorts to using strength, the technique is being performed incorrectly and will likely not work. Because of the principle of no strength, Hakko&#772; Denshin is accessible to anyone, young or old, short or small, light or heavy, strong or weak. (We encourage students to work with people of varying physiques in order to learn how to apply the techniques to differnt body types. Strength will work on some, but not all. Working with a stronger opponent is a good way of learning to yield and relax.)
  <p>Many of the techniques are based off of natural movements, actions as simple as scratching an itchy ear, pointing a finger, or kneeling (some of them are more absurd, such as squashing a cockroach, slicing baby carrots, or serving Vancouver chicken!), which makes them very instinctive and easy to master.</p>
  <p>What qualifies ju&#772;jutsu as the Gentle Art is that we strive minimize injury to assailants. Many other martial arts claim to be "self-defense," but teach students to injure, maim, or kill. Ju&#772;jutsu is a much more humanitarian, moral art. We do not believe in "an eye for an eye." Our techniques use painful locks and nonlethal blows to control the opponent without inflicting injury.</p>
  <p>As a completely defensive and humanitarian art, ju&#772ljutsu is not meant for competition. In many cases, competition results in injury, sometimes irreversible.</p>
  <p>Although we endeavor to be gentle with opponents, it is stil possible that situations may arise in which desperate measures must be taken. The <i>exceptional circumstances</i>, which give rise to the need to injure opponents, are limited to group attacks and life-or-death combat.</p>

<h6>*Godan is an honorary rank for black belts training for the Shihan test.</h6>
In addition to the dan ranks there are also the ranks of Shihan (Master), Kaiden (Master of the Deepest Mysteries), and San Daikichu (Three Great Pillars). These masters wear purple belts, as it is the royal color of Japan. The title So&#772;ke is not a rank, but instead means "head of the family," or more commonly translated as "head/founder of the art."

<h1 id="techniques" class="title">Techniques&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xfe3d;</h1>
<span id="techniques-container" class="container">
In Hakko&#772; Denshin Ryu&#772;, there are two different types of techniques that we learn: waza and henka, which will be described later in the page. Every technique has three fundamental principles in common which are balance, stance, and yielding. These three principles are heavily interconnected. Maintaining balance while off-balancing opponents is vital to Hakko&#772; techniques. A good stance is the key to having balance. As for off-balancing, this is best accomplished by yielding to the opponent's strength and gently pushing or pulling in the direction of the opponent's momentum.
<p>Two more principles that are fundamental to most Hakko&#772; techniques are gakun and atemi. An atemi is a strike to the opponent's body. Atemi are used to exhaust, distract, and disorient the opponent in order to off-balance or lock. Many atemi target the points along the shiatsu meridian lines, such as those along the gall bladder meridians, <span title="&#32966;&#32076;">Tan Kei</span>, which run down each side of the neck, torso, and leg. Gakun is a type of grip unique to Hakko&#772; Ryu&#772; and Hakko&#772; Denshin Ryu&#772; in which the index finger is extended and the grip is applied on one side of the opponent's wrist or hand with the remaining three fingers and opposed on the other side by the thumb. Pressure is applied by squeezing with the pinky and flexing or radially deviating the hand. Gakun invokes an acute pain in the meridian lines on the wrist, which is why it is so effective.</p>
<p>We at the Daiko Shibu Do&#772jo&#772, we often say that Hakko&#772 students strike like karate students, throw like ju&#772do&#772 students, and lock like nobody else!</p>
<p>In addition to the fundamental principals, each technique has a principle defined by the nature of the finishing move:</p>

<h2 id="waza">Waza&mdash;The Basic Techniques</h2>
The basic techniques of Hakko&#772; Denshin Ryu&#772; are known as <span title="&#25216;">waza</span>, which are organized into lists called <span title="&#25216;">gi</span>. Waza correspond to the kata of other martial arts.
<p>The intent of learning base waza is for students to develop the muscle memory for the basic principles and stances in order to use them instinctively in real self-defense situations. Waza are taught starting with kneeling techniques so that students can focus on learning hand movements and then continuing to standing techniques to integrate stance into the techniques.</p>

<p>Although it may look impressive, this is merely a list of the waza and contains no information about how to perform them. However, the methods of these waza can be found in the <a href="http://www.hakkojujutsu.com/Shop">Hakko&#772; Denshin Ryu&#772; Training Manuals</a>. It is to be noted that these training manuals are not a replacement for a proper instructor; although you may be able to learn the gross movements from the training manuals, only a Hakko&#772; Denshin sensei can correct errors and illuminate subtleties that can be vital to the techniques' effectiveness.</p>

<h2 id="henka">Henka&mdash;Variations on the Basic Principles</h2>
Henka, or variations, are applications of the principles learned in waza. We practice henka as a simulation of real self-defense situations. They are a way to test the muscle memory we develop from waza and train our ability to effectively react to an attack. Although henka are a simulation of combat on the street, it is of utmost importance to be gentle to your training partners to prevent injury and to help keep the do&#772;jo&#772; an environment conducive to learning. It is advised that during henka, you move slowly but fluidly, always maintaining control of the opponent.
<p>A general rule of thumb for henka is this:</p>
  <ol>
<li><b><u>E</u></b>scape: It is imperative you escape the assailant's attack before you can taking control of the situation.</li>
<li><b><u>S</u></b>trike: The best way to disorient and off-balance the opponent is to strike. We advise a minimum of 2 strikes per henka.</li>
<li><b><u>O</u></b>ff-Balance: If you keep the opponent off balance, you have the opponent under your control.</li>
<li><b><u>L</u></b>ock: Finally, once you have avoided the attack, tenderized the opponent, and gained control of the encounter, you can finish the technique.</li>
  </ol>
  If you try it backwards, you will <b><u>LOSE</u></b>.
  <h3>Random Henka Generator</h3>
  Although on belt tests, you are required to come up with the henka you use, we have created a tool to help those who are not feeling particularly creative to come up with henka attacks.
  <h6>Disclaimer: not all of these attacks will be realistic. Future updates to the henka generator tool may see a neural net to eliminate ridiculous combinations. They also may not. I don't get paid for this.</h6>
